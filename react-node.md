## Getting Started with React with Node JS

#

### Setup and Running
1. First we need to install Node.js. Head over to 'https://nodejs.org/en/download/' then download and install the version of Node.js depending on your operating system.

2. Create a folder for the new project 

        $ mkdir server
        $ cd server

3. Initiate a node project to have the package.json file 

        $ npm init
    This will ask you a lot of question, for now you can go through all default setting pressing a number of Enter key

    Now that our Node project is ready to add dependency.

4. We will use Node Express add them in our project 

        $ npm install --save express
